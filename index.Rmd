# Part 1

## What a computer can do


---

# Data

--

- any kind of data is a collection of 0 and 1

- basic unity of information is a **bit**

- any kind of is a collection of **bits**

- an octet is a collection of 8 bits

- a kilo-octet (ko) is a collection of 1000 octets

- beware of the *bytes*


---

# What does a computer do?


--

- **the core a computer can only change 0 to 1 and 1 to 0**

--

- comes with a collection of I/O devices


- very, very fast computation on bits  


- that's actually enough!


---

# What does a computer do?


- 8 bits to represent and integer (a natural number betwenn 0 and $2^8 = 256$)

- `c = a + b`

--

- `a = 11`: `00001011` ![:faic](long-arrow-right) $2^3 + 2^1 + 1 = 8 + 2 + 1 = 11$

- `b = 14`: `00001110`

--

- `c = ?` `c = 10101101`

--

- a + b: `00001110 + 00001011`

---

# What does a computer do?

<br>

```
        00001110
      + 00001011
      ==========
      = 00011001
```

- 1+8+16 = 25


---

# What does a computer do?

<br>

```
       1011   (this is 11 in binary)
     x 1110   (this is 14 in binary)
    =========
       0000   (this is 1011 x 0)
      1011    (this is 1011 x 1, shifted one position to the left)
     1011     (this is 1011 x 1, shifted two positions to the left)
  + 1011      (this is 1011 x 1, shifted three positions to the left)
    =========
    10011010   (this is 154 in binary)
```

# What does a computer do?

## But what about... everything else?

- For instance $e^2$

--

- Use Math! $e^2 = e \times e$

--
- you only need $e$

--

- `math.h` includes its value $2.718281828459045235360287471352662498$

--
- **Conclusion**: we actually need a lot of math to do math using additions only <i class="fa fa-long-arrow-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> the era of algorithms

# Solving ODE with additions

## no more but no less

---

# Solving an ODE

- $\dot{x} = f(x,\theta, t)$

--

- Solution $x(t) = g(t,\theta, x_0)$

--

- remember $\dot{x} = ax$, here $\theta = a$

--

- three cases:

  1. doable by hand

  2. get an analytical solution with a computer

  3. get a numerical approximation



---

# doable by hand

- Done! a computer... what for?

--

- to do further analysis / plot for a given $x_0$ / draw vector fields...

--

```
  Function solution(x0, θ, t)
    return g(x0, θ, t)
  end
```


---

# Get an analytical solution *in silico*


- a bit more complex...

--

- Maple https://fr.maplesoft.com/support/help/maple/view.aspx?path=dsolve

- Sage http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/calculus/sage/calculus/desolvers.html

- Mathematica http://reference.wolfram.com/language/howto/SolveADifferentialEquation.html


- the magick of `dsolve`

---

# Get a numerical approximation

- $\dot{x} = \frac{dx}{dt} = f(x,\theta, t)$ and $x(0) = x_0$

--

- Idea: $x_0$ what about $x_{dt}$ ...

--

$$x_{dt} = x_0 + \sum_i^\infty \frac{1}{n!} \frac{dx^{(n)}}{dt^n} (dt)^n $$

--

$$dt > dt^2 > dt^3 > ... $$

--

$$x_{dt} = x_0 + \frac{dx}{dt}x =  x_0 + \frac{dx}{dt}\dot{x}$$


---

# Get a numerical approximation

- Now I have $x_0$, $x_{dt}$, what next?

--

- repeat same process to get $x_{2dt}$

--

- only multiplications and additions... so use algorithms!


---

# Euler's methods

```
\\ function
Function myode(x, θ, t)
  f(x, θ, t)
end


\\ Euler
Function(x0, t0, dt, niter, myode)
  x = vector(niter)
  x[0] = x0
  for 1:niter  
    do x[i] = x[i-1] + x[i-1] myode(x[i-1], θ, t)
  end

  return x
end
